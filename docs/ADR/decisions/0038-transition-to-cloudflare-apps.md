# 38. Transition to Cloudflare Apps 🌩️

Date: 2023-06-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We've been relying on Google Analytics (GA) for tracking, analyzing, and reporting our website traffic. 
The GA code is embedded into our codebase, causing issues like increased page load times, the need for frequent developer 
interventions for GA updates, and the inability to swiftly modify tracking code. 
As we aim for a flexible, efficient, and user-friendly setup, we need to consider a change.

## Decision

We have decided to shift to Cloudflare Apps to integrate Google Analytics with our website. 🔄 This move will enable 
us to detach the GA script from our codebase and instead handle our analytics setup via Cloudflare's interface. 
This decision also anticipates future integrations with other apps via the Cloudflare platform.

## Consequences

+ 🚀 Ease of Use: Managing our GA setup becomes more straightforward, permitting rapid changes to our tracking code without a development team.
+ ⚡ Performance Enhancement: Cloudflare's handling of GA scripts might reduce our webpage load times, contributing to better user experience.
+ 🛠️ Developer Efficiency: By removing GA scripts, our developers can concentrate on enhancing feature sets rather than maintaining analytics code.
+ 📈 Versatility: Cloudflare Apps hosts a variety of plugins and services, laying a solid groundwork for any additional integrations in the future.

However, this decision also introduces some risks:

+ 🔄 Transition Phase: A meticulous setup and transition phase is required to prevent data loss or discrepancies in analytics.
+ 📊 Dependency: Our analytics setup will now rely on Cloudflare. Any downtimes or issues on their part could impact our data tracking.
+ 👮 Privacy and Security: We need to carefully review Cloudflare's data handling and privacy policies to ensure compliance with our standards and regulations.
