# 13. Enhancing Security Measures

Date: 2023-01-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The necessity to bolster the security of our application has been identified, particularly in relation to the encryption of secret data during deployment.

## Decision

### Management of Secrets

To protect secret data during deployment, we have decided to utilize [SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops).

- For **HELM**, the [helm-secrets](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets/wiki/Usage) plugin will be employed.
- For **ArgoCD**, we will integrate with [Argo CD Integration](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets/blob/main/docs/ArgoCD%20Integration.md).

The following diagram illustrates the process:

    style D fill:#f9a825,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#f9a825,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#f9a825,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style H fill:#f9a825,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```  

### Security in Kubernetes

To identify potential security issues within our cluster, we will use [kubescape](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape).

### Supply Chain Security

To ensure the security of our supply chain, we will adopt [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/). For docker builds, the flags `--sbom=true` and `--provenance=true` will be added.

## Consequences

+ The use of SOPS will be required to decrypt secret data prior to deployment.
+ Kubescape will be used to regularly scan our cluster for potential security issues.
+ SLSA will be adopted to ensure the security of our supply chain.
