# 30. Ubiquitous Language

Date: 2024-01-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In response to communication challenges in our diverse team, we're adopting the Ubiquitous Language practice from Domain-Driven Design. 
This strategy, highlighted in the Open Practice Library, focuses on creating a shared language to minimize misunderstandings 
and ensure clarity in complex software development projects. It's crucial for aligning the team's understanding of key 
project concepts and terminology.

## Decision

We will establish and use a Ubiquitous Language in all communications, code, and documentation. This language will 
be developed collaboratively and evolve with the project to maintain relevance and clarity. 
To facilitate this, a **GLOSSARY.md** file will be created and maintained for each subdomain.

## Consequences

This decision will streamline internal communication and reduce ambiguity, leading to more efficient project progress. 
However, it requires ongoing effort to maintain and adapt the language to the project's evolving needs.
