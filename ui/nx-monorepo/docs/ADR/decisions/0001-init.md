# 1. Init

Date: 2023-04-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our project consists of multiple applications and libraries, which are interdependent and need to be managed efficiently. 
Monorepos allow for easier maintenance, cross-package code sharing, and improved developer productivity.

## Decision

We will set up a monorepo using Nx to streamline development and manage our applications and libraries more efficiently.

### Alternatives

- Use a multi-repo approach
- Use turborepo
- Use lerna

#### Turborepo

Turborepo is a tool that allows you to manage multiple repos as a single repo. 
It is similar to Nx, but it is not as mature and does not have as many features.

#### Benchmarking Nx, Turbo, and Lerna

## Consequences

By initializing an Nx monorepo, we can expect the following benefits:

- Improved developer productivity
- Easier maintenance
- Cross-package code sharing
- Improved CI/CD

However, there are some potential drawbacks:

- Increased complexity for developers unfamiliar with monorepos or Nx.
