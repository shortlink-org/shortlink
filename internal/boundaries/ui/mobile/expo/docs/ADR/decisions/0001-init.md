# 1. Adopting Expo Monorepo with Nx for Shortlink Service Client

Date: 2023-09-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our team is tasked with developing a mobile client for a shortlink service. 
This client will allow users to generate, manage, and track shortlinks from their mobile devices. 
We need a framework that supports rapid development, cross-platform compatibility, and offers a rich set of built-in features. 
Additionally, we anticipate the need for future mobile applications that might share components or 
libraries with our shortlink service client, necessitating a monorepo structure.

## Decision

We have chosen to use Expo in conjunction with Nx to create a monorepo for our shortlink service client. 
Nx provides tools for monorepo management, enabling us to structure our client application and potential shared libraries 
in an integrated repository. This approach will enable us to:

- Develop the shortlink service client as an Expo app within the monorepo.
- Potentially share code between this client and future apps using Nx libraries.
- Utilize a unified build and test process across all apps and libraries.

## Consequences

- **Shared Components**: With Nx, we can create shared UI libraries that can be used across the shortlink service client 
  and potential future apps, promoting code reusability and consistency.

- **Integrated Development**: The Nx workspace will house our Expo shortlink service client and its associated 
  end-to-end tests under the `apps` folder, and any shared libraries under the `libs` folder. This structure simplifies 
  dependency management and promotes code sharing.

- **Tech Stack Integration**: The guide provides steps to integrate various tech stacks like Material design library (`react-native-paper`) 
  and routing (`@react-navigation/native`), ensuring a rich user experience for our shortlink service client.

- **Build and Deployment**: With the integration of EAS (Expo Application Services), we can streamline the build and deployment process 
  for our Expo client. EAS provides tools for building app binaries and submitting them to app stores.

- **Dependency on Nx and Expo**: By adopting this approach, we become reliant on both Nx and Expo. 
  Any significant changes or issues in either platform could impact our development process.

In conclusion, the combination of Expo and Nx offers a robust solution for developing the shortlink service client within a monorepo, 
promoting code reusability, and streamlining the build and deployment process. 
However, teams should be prepared for the initial setup and be aware of the dependencies on both platforms.
