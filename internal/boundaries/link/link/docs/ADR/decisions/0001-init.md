## Context

We are building ShortLink, a service dedicated to managing and manipulating short links. 
The Link domain is the root of this service, setting the focus of our decision. Our aim is to provide a reliable and 
flexible service for working with links. Our plan includes functionalities such as CRUD and SQRS operations for links, 
parsing of sitemaps to save links, and an architecture employing the C4 model. 
This architecture precisely outlines the interactions between the customer, the gateway, and the underlying services.

We have chosen Go (Golang) as our primary language for building this service. Go is known for its simplicity, 
performance, and strong support for concurrent programming. Additionally, we have adopted the Clean Architecture, 
which promotes separation of concerns and makes the system easy to evolve and maintain.

**Core Functionality:**

  * CRUD operations for link
  * SQRS operations for link
  * parse sitemap and save links

## Decision

We've decided to initiate the development of the Link domain, serving as the root of the ShortLink service. 
The functionalities and architectural choices - including using Go and the Clean Architecture - have been determined. 
To aid testing, we're supporting reflection in requests, simplifying the process for developers and users through 
tools such as Postman or grpcurl.

## Consequences

This decision marks the initiation of the ShortLink service, starting with the Link domain. We expect our 
choice of functionalities, Go as a programming language, the Clean Architecture, and the C4 model for outlining 
system interactions to result in an efficient and user-friendly service.

Supporting reflection in requests should simplify testing, but it does introduce a need for comprehensive documentation 
and usage examples, adding another ongoing commitment for our team.
