# ADR-0001: Project Initialization

Date: 2023-06-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The decision to start the development of a new billing service has been approved. 
The service needs to provide functionality for managing payments and tariffs, hence a solid base is crucial 
for further development and maintainability.

## Decision

The project will be initialized with the following considerations:

- We will use the C4 model for architecture design and descriptions.
- The project will be structured in a way to provide easy CRUD operations for payment and tariff management.
- We will use PlantUML for creating diagrams that provide a clear understanding of the system's functionality 
  and its interaction with users.
- The project documentation, including ADRs, will be maintained in the `docs/ADR/decisions` directory.

For the project tech stack and architectural pattern, we will use:

- We will use Go (Golang) for the development of the service. Its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support 
  for concurrent programming make it an excellent choice for building fast and reliable server-side applications.
- We will use gRPC for the API. It is a modern, open-source, high-performance RPC framework that can run in any environment. 
  It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, 
  health checking, and authentication.
- We will use PostgreSQL as our database. PostgreSQL's support for both SQL and JSON makes it an excellent choice 
  for our use case, and it has robust support for ACID transactions, views, foreign keys, and stored procedures.
- We will use Event Sourcing for persisting events. This will provide us with an audit log of all changes made 
  in the system and allow us to reconstruct past states. This pattern is beneficial for systems where the business 
  requires full auditability and traceability.
- We will implement the CQRS pattern, separating the read and write operations for a data source. 
  This will provide us with flexibility in our design and can improve performance, scalability, and security.
- We will follow the principles of Clean Architecture to make the system more independent, adaptable, 
  and maintainable. It will facilitate the separation of concerns, which will enhance testability and flexibility.

## Consequences

With this setup, we establish a robust foundation for our billing service. It allows us to start the project 
in a structured and well-documented manner. The chosen tech stack, architectural patterns, and methodologies cater 
to our needs for a scalable, reliable, auditable, and maintainable system. Future ADRs will detail the architectural 
decisions related to specific parts of the system.
