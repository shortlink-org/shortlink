# Cache

This repository contains the `cache` package, a Go package that provides a high-level interface to cache operations used 
in the **Shortlink** project. This package leverages `go-redis/cache` to provide a comprehensive caching solution 
that includes both local and Redis-based caching.

## Getting Started

This package is designed to be imported and used in other Go applications.

```go
import (
	"github.com/go-redis/cache/v9"

	"github.com/shortlink-org/shortlink/internal/pkg/cache"
)
```

## Features

- Easy interface to handle cache operations such as `Set`, `SetXX`, `SetNX`, `Get`, and `Del`.
- Uses a hybrid local and Redis-based caching system for enhanced performance and scalability.
- Uses TinyLFU (Least Frequently Used) algorithm for local cache eviction strategy.

## Usage

### Initialization

To create a new instance of the cache client, use the `New` function:

```go
ctx := context.Background()
cacheClient, err := cache.New(ctx)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

### Setting Values

You can add values to the cache using the `Set`, `SetXX`, or `SetNX` functions:

```go
key := "myKey"
value := "myValue"

err := cacheClient.Set(ctx, cache.Item{
  Key:   key,
  Value: value,
})
```

### Getting Values

Retrieve values from the cache using the `Get` function:

```go
key := "myKey"
resp := cache2.Item{}
err := cacheClient.Get(ctx, key, &resp)
```

### Deleting Values

You can delete one or more values from the cache using the `Del` function:

```go
err := cacheClient.Delete(ctx, "key1")
```

## Requirements

This package requires Go 1.18 or later. The Go-Redis/Cache and Rueidis libraries are required and will be installed when you install the package.
