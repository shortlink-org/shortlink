# 1. Init Link Boundary context

Date: 2024-01-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

ShortLink is a service designed for shortening URLs. The core functional requirement of ShortLink is the efficient 
handling of shortened URLs, which includes generating metadata, creating screenshots, and managing redirections. 
The link boundary context is established to modularize these functionalities into separate services: Metadata, 
Screenshot, and Proxy. This structure supports the primary goal of URL shortening and enhances system performance, 
scalability, and maintainability.

## Decision

We have restructured the link boundary context into three distinct services:

+ **Link Service:** Responsible for creating, updating, deleting, and managing short links. It serves as the core 
for URL shortening functionalities.
+ **Metadata Service:** Adds context to each link by fetching and storing URL metadata and generating screenshots. 
This service enriches the data associated with each short link.
+ **Proxy Service:** Acts as a bridge, redirecting short links to their original URLs. It plays a crucial role 
in the seamless redirection and analytics tracking of the short links.

Each service is designed to focus on specific aspects of the ShortLink functionality, ensuring efficiency and clarity 
in the system's architecture.

## Consequences

This restructuring enhances system modularity and scalability system.
