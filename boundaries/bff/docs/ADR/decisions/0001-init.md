# 1. Introduce a BFF Service for the Web Application

Date: 2023-04-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our web application is currently using an API gateway to communicate with multiple microservices. 
As the number of microservices increases and the requirements of the web application become more specific, 
we find that the API gateway's one-size-fits-all approach doesn't cater well to the web application's needs. 
We are considering introducing a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) service that will be tailored to the specific 
requirements of the web application and will replace the API gateway.

## Decision

We will transition from using the API gateway to a BFF service for our web application. 
The new BFF service will be built using Golang, leveraging its strong performance and concurrency capabilities. 
This BFF service will act as a single point of contact between the web application and the microservices, 
handling aggregation, orchestration, and transformation of data from the microservices before 
sending it to the web application.

The main responsibilities of the BFF service will include:

1. Proxying requests from the web application to the appropriate microservices.
2. Aggregating and transforming data from multiple microservices into a format suitable for the web application.
3. Implementing caching strategies to improve performance and reduce the load on microservices.
4. Handling error scenarios and providing consistent error responses to the web application.

The BFF service will be designed to cater specifically to the needs of the web application, 
and it will evolve in parallel with the web application's requirements.

## Consequences

Introducing a BFF service for the web application will have the following consequences:

1. **Improved performance**: By aggregating and transforming data in the BFF service, 
  the web application will make fewer calls to microservices, which will improve performance and user experience.
2. **Increased complexity**: Introducing a BFF service adds another layer to the architecture, which could increase 
  complexity and maintenance effort. However, we believe that the benefits of improved performance and 
  separation of concerns outweigh this drawback.
