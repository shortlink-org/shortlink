# UC-1: Evaluate A/B Experiment Results (Reports)

## Overview

This use case focuses on generating and evaluating reports for A/B experiments. Reports are created on a monthly basis to provide insights into the performance of different experiment variations. However, the data used for these reports can be accessed at any time for reconciliation or further analysis.

### Flow

1. **Experiment Data Collection**:

  - Throughout the month, data is collected for each active experiment, including user interactions and outcomes for each variation.

2. **Monthly Report Generation**:

  - At the end of each month, the system generates a detailed report, summarizing the performance of each variation.

3. **Reconciliation Access**:

  - The experiment data remains accessible at any time for reconciliation or real-time evaluation, allowing teams to make informed decisions outside of the regular reporting cycle.

### Key Features

- Generate monthly reports automatically.
- Provide access to experiment data for reconciliation purposes.
- Offer insights into the success and performance of variations.
