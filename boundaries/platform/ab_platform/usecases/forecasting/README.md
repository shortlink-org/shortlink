# UC-2: Forecasting for Future Experiments

## Overview

This use case focuses on providing tools to forecast the outcomes of future A/B experiments based on existing data. By analyzing past experiments, the system generates predictions to help teams plan future tests and optimize variations.

### Flow

1. **Historical Data Analysis**:

  - The system reviews past experiment data to identify trends, success rates, and performance metrics.

2. **Forecast Generation**:

  - Using the historical data, the system generates forecasts, providing expected outcomes for future experiments based on various conditions or parameters.

3. **Experiment Planning**:

  - Forecasts can be used to guide decision-making during the planning phase of new experiments, helping teams choose optimal variations and target groups.

### Key Features

- Analyze historical experiment data to generate forecasts.
- Predict future experiment outcomes based on trends.
- Assist in the planning and optimization of new experiments.
