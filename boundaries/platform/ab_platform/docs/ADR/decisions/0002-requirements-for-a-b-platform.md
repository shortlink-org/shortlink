# 2. Requirements for A/B Platform

Date: 2024-09-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The **A/B platform** must be able to handle a high volume of requests for managing experiments and retrieving experiment 
data, as it will be integrated into multiple services. To ensure the platform performs efficiently and scales as needed, 
we have set specific performance and scalability requirements.

The primary goal is to support **100 requests per second (RPS)** at a minimum, which accounts for the potential 
growth of the system and the number of concurrent experiments running at any given time.

## Decision

We will set the following requirements for the platform:

### 1. **Functional Requirements**:

- The platform will provide APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting test cases (CRUD operations).
- The platform will allow for the definition of test variations, user assignment logic, and result collection.
- It will support real-time data collection, experiment analysis, and performance metrics reporting.

### 2. **Performance and Scalability Requirements**:

- The platform must handle **100 requests per second (RPS)** at a minimum, with the ability to scale as needed.
- API responses should be efficient, with latency under **200 milliseconds** for most CRUD operations and data retrieval.
- The system should support concurrent experiments without performance degradation.

### 3. **Non-Functional Requirements**:

- The platform should be highly available, with an uptime target of **99.95%**.
- Data consistency is critical, ensuring that all experiment-related data (test cases, results, etc.) is accurately stored and retrievable.
- The platform should have security controls in place to ensure that experiments and user data are protected.

## Consequences

- **Scalability**: The platform must be designed with scalability in mind, ensuring it can handle an increasing load as the number of experiments and users grows.
- **High Availability**: To meet the performance and availability goals, the platform may require horizontal scaling, database optimization, and caching strategies.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Performance metrics and logs must be implemented to track API performance and ensure that the 100 RPS target is met consistently.
