# Landscape2 settings
#
# This settings file allows customizing some aspects of the landscape.

# Foundation (required)
#
# Name of the foundation. This value is used in some labels, so we recommended
# to keep it as short as possible.
#
# foundation: <FOUNDATION_NAME>
#
foundation: ShortLink

# Url (required)
#
# Url where the landscape will be hosted.
#
# url: <LANDSCAPE_URL>
#
url: https://landscape.shortlink.best/

# Analytics (optional)
#
# Analytics providers configuration. When an analytics provider is set up, some
# additional code from the provider will be injected into the web application.
#
# analytics:
#   gtm:                            # Google Tag Manager configuration
#     container_id: <CONTAINER_ID>  # Landscape web application container ID

# Categories (optional)
#
# Categories information is read from the `landscape.yml` data file. The way
# categories are displayed in the web application is computed dynamically based
# on the number of categories and subcategories, as well as the number of items
# on each. Sometimes, however, we may want subcategories to be displayed in a
# specific order within a category (this happens often in the Members category).
# In those cases, it is possible to define that order by overriding a category.
#
# This option can also be used to not display one or more subcategories in the
# landscape. To achieve that, we only need to exclude the subcategory from the
# subcategories list when overriding a category.
#
categories:
  - name: ShortLink
    subcategories:
      - api
      - auth

# Featured items (optional)
#
# This section allows highlighting items that match certain criteria. You can
# define a list of rules and the matching items will be featured in a special
# way in the landscape.
#
# Each rule must define a field for the check as well as the values that will
# trigger a match. At the moment the fields supported are:
#
#   - maturity
#   - subcategory
#
# When a given item's field matches any of the values provided, it will be
# considered a featured item. For each option, it is possible to also define an
# order (which item would be displayed first) and a label for the item.
#
# featured_items:
#   - field: subcategory
#     options:
#       - value: <SUBCATEGORY1_NAME>
#       - value: <SUBCATEGORY2_NAME>
#
featured_items:
  - field: maturity
    options:
      - value: graduated

# Grid items size (optional)
#
# Defines the preferred size of the landscape items in the grid mode. When the
# landscape contains many items, it is recommended to use the `small` size.
# However, if there aren't many items, choosing `medium` or `large` may make
# the landscape look nicer. Users will still be able to adjust the items size
# from the UI using the zoom controls.
#
# grid_items_size: <small|medium|large>
#
grid_items_size: medium

# Groups (optional)
#
# In some cases, specially when a landscape contains lots of items, it may be
# interesting to organize them in groups. Each group will be displayed on a
# different tab in the landscape web application. Each entry must contain the
# name of the group (it will be displayed as is) and a list with the categories
# (as defined in the landscape.yml data file) that will be part of this group.
#
# groups:
#   - name: <GROUP_NAME>
#     categories:
#       - <CATEGORY1_NAME>
#       - <CATEGORY2_NAME>
#
groups:
  - name: All categories
    categories:
      - ShortLink
      - Infrastructure

# Header (optional)
#
# This section allows customizing some aspects of the header.
header:
  links:
    github: "https://github.com/shortlink-org"
  logo: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncf/artwork/master/other/cncf-landscape/horizontal/color/cncf-landscape-horizontal-color.svg"

# Images (optional)
#
# Urls of some images used in the landscape UI.
#
# images:
#   favicon: <FAVICON_URL>
#   open_graph: <OPEN_GRAPH_IMAGE_URL>
#

# Name of the members category (optional)
#
# Landscapes usually have a special category dedicated to the members of the
# corresponding foundation. It is possible to use any name for that category,
# but it is important that we define it here as there are some special
# operations that depend on it.
#
members_category: ShortLink

# Osano (optional)
#
# Osano cookies consent form configuration. When the Osano configuration is
# provided, some additional code will be injected into the web application.
#
# The `customer_id` and `customer_configuration_id` fields values can be
# obtained from the url in the configuration script code available on the Osano
# site:
#
#   https://cmp.osano.com/<CUSTOMER_ID>/<CUSTOMER_CONFIGURATION_ID>/osano.js
#
# osano:
#   customer_id: <CUSTOMER_ID>
#   customer_configuration_id: <CUSTOMER_CONFIGURATION_ID>
#

# Screenshot width (optional)
#
# Width of the landscape screenshots automatically generated (in pixels).
# Screenshots won't be taken if this value is not provided.
#
# screenshot_width: <WIDTH_IN_PIXELS>
#
screenshot_width: 1500

# TAGs (optional)
#
# Projects items can specify which TAG owns them in the `landscape.yml` file
# (by using the `tag` field in the `extra` item's section). However, sometimes
# this information is not available at the item level. This configuration
# section provides a mechanism to automatically asign a TAG to projects items
# based on the categories and subcategories they belong to.
#
# For example, we can define that all projects in the category <CATEGORY1> are
# owned by <TAG1>. When the items are processed, the corresponding TAG will be
# set in the items that match the rule defined. The TAG defined at the item
# level always takes precedence, so when it's present it won't be replaced.
#
# NOTE: TAGs names should only use lowercase case letters and hyphens (no
# spaces or other characters), and should not be prefixed with "tag". The
# subcategories field is optional and, when omitted, all of them will be
# included.
#
# tags:
#   <TAG1>:
#     - category: <CATEGORY1>
#       subcategories:
#         - <SUBCATEGORY1>
#         - <SUBCATEGORY2>
#   <TAG2>:
#     - category: <CATEGORY2>
#
tags:
  language:
    - category: Golang
    - category: JavaScript
    - category: Python
    - category: Rust

# Upcoming event (optional)
#
# This section allows configuring an upcoming event that will be featured on
# the landscape web application. Expired events won't be displayed.
#
# upcoming_event:
#   name: <NAME>         # Event name (required)
#   start: <START_DATE>  # Start date: (required, format: YYYY-MM-DD)
#   end: <END_DATE>      # End date: (required, format: YYYY-MM-DD)
#   banner_url: <URL>    # Event banner image url (required, recommended dimensions: 2400x300)
#   details_url: <URL>   # Event details URL (required)
