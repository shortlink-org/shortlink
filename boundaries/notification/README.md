## Notification Boundary

> [!NOTE]
> The Notification Boundary in a software system is dedicated to managing and delivering various types of alerts 
> and messages to users. It covers a range of notification methods, including push notifications for immediate attention, 
> email and SMS notifications for broader communication, and in-app notifications for app-specific information. 
> This boundary also includes user preferences for notification management, ensuring that users receive relevant alerts 
> in their preferred manner. The effective implementation of this boundary is crucial for keeping users informed and engaged, 
> enhancing user experience, and ensuring timely communication of important information or updates.
