# 3. C4 Model

Date: 2024-09-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To provide clarity in the architecture of the new currency conversion service, we will utilize the C4 model. 
This model will help visualize the systemâ€™s structure and components, allowing developers and stakeholders to easily 
understand how the system is built and how different parts interact. The C4 model will include System Context 
and Container diagrams, with the addition of a cache store to optimize performance.

## Decision

We will apply the C4 model to the Currency Service to create System Context and Container diagrams to better visualize 
the architecture. A cache layer will be added to store frequently accessed exchange rates and reduce the load on external 
APIs and databases.

## Consequences

- Improved understanding of the overall architecture and the integration with external services like Bloomberg and Yahoo.
- Better communication between team members and stakeholders.
- Increased efficiency in future development and maintenance of the service.
