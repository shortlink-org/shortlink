## Billing Boundary

> [!NOTE]
> The Billing Boundary in a software system deals with the financial transactions aspect of the application. 
> It encompasses the integration and management of payment gateways, processors, and e-wallets to facilitate online 
> transactions. This boundary includes handling customer checkouts, invoicing, and ensuring secure transaction processes. 
> It also involves implementing fraud detection mechanisms to safeguard against unauthorized transactions and managing 
> recurring payments for subscriptions. Effective management within this boundary is crucial for ensuring a smooth, 
> secure, and user-friendly payment experience for customers.
