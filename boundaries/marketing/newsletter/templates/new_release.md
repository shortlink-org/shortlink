Hi %FIRST_NAME%,

We've just released a new shortlink feature which will make creating and sharing links much easier. With this new release, you'll now be able to create shortlinks right from your browser without having to leave the page you're on.

Best of all, you can also track how many clicks each link has received!

You can check out our new feature list below:
- Create shortlinks without leaving the page you're on
- View how many clicks each link has received
- Track the performance of your shortlinks over time
- Generate QR codes for your links
- Share links on social media or embed them in your website or blog post.
  Do you have any questions about our new features? Let me know and I'll be happy to help. :)

Sincerely, %YOUR_NAME%
