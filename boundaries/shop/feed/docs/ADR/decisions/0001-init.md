# 1. Init Feed Service

Date: 2024-10-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To provide personalized content feeds for partners, we need a service that generates XML-based feeds (`feeds.xml`) based on client preferences. The feed generation process should run automatically every 24 hours, delivering updated feeds to our partners. We will use a Kubernetes CronJob to schedule and manage the feed generation task, and the logic for generating these feeds will utilize CEL (Common Expression Language) to ensure flexible and dynamic content creation.

## Decision

We will build the Feed Service in Go, using a Kubernetes CronJob to trigger feed generation every 24 hours. The feeds will be stored as `feeds.xml` in Minio (an S3-like block store), and the data required for feed generation will be fetched via GraphQL from other services. CEL will be employed to allow for flexible rules and logic based on the preferences of each partner.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Automated feed generation every 24 hours, eliminating manual processes.
- Use of CEL provides flexibility in feed content generation, allowing dynamic rules for partner preferences.
- Scalable and efficient scheduling of tasks with Kubernetes CronJobs.
- Feeds are delivered in a standardized `feeds.xml` format, ensuring compatibility with partner systems.

**Negative:**

- Kubernetes CronJob management may require additional monitoring and maintenance to handle potential failures or scaling needs.
