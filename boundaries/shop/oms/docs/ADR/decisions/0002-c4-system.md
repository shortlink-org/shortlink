# 2. C4 system

Date: 2024-05-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to understand the internal architecture of individual containers in our system.

## Decision

Adopt a Level 3 C4 Component Diagram. This diagram will focus on the components within each container,
showing how they interact internally and with external elements.

## Consequences

Provides an in-depth view of the internal architecture of containers, aiding in development and troubleshooting.
