            If you access the Website from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the
            laws of your jurisdiction. The provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply
            to these Terms. A party may give notice to the other party only in writing at that party's principal place of business,
            attention of that party's principal legal officer, or at such other address or by such other method as the party shall specify
            in writing. Notice shall be deemed given upon personal delivery or facsimile, or, if sent by certified mail with postage
            prepaid, 5 business days after the date of mailing, or, if sent by international overnight courier with postage prepaid, 7
            business days after the date of mailing. If any provision herein is held to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will
            continue in full force without being affected in any way. Further, the parties agree to replace such unenforceable provision
            with an enforceable provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the unenforceable provision.

            section. The failure of the Operators to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others does not constitute a

            proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or User's use of the Website must be brought in the courts of Belgium,
            and you consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Any cause of action you may have with respect
            to your use of the Website must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises. These Terms set
            forth the entire understanding and agreement of the parties, and supersedes any and all oral or written agreements or
            understandings between the parties, as to their subject matter. The waiver of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall
            not be construed as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.
