## Context

We are developing **ShortLink**, a dedicated service for managing and manipulating short URLs. 
The core domain of this service is **Link**, which serves as the foundation for all related functionalities. 
Our primary goals are to deliver a reliable, flexible, and high-performance service.

### Functional Requirements

  - **URL Shortening:** Generate a short URL from a given long URL.
  - **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete links.
  - **CQRS Operations:** Implement Command Query Responsibility Segregation for efficient data handling.
  - **Sitemap Parsing:** Extract and store links from sitemaps.

### Non-Functional Requirements

  - **Performance:** Ensure low latency and high throughput.
  - **Scalability:** Support growth in the number of users and links without degradation.
  - **Reliability:** Maintain consistent uptime and handle failures gracefully.
  - **Security:** Protect against common vulnerabilities and ensure data privacy.
  - **Maintainability:** Facilitate easy updates and modifications.
  - **Testability:** Enable comprehensive testing for all components.
  - **Flexibility:** Allow for future feature expansions and integrations.
  - **Availability:** Guarantee high availability to meet user demands.

### Architectural Considerations

  - **Programming Language:** We have selected **Go (Golang)** for its simplicity, performance, and robust support for concurrent programming.
  - **Architecture Pattern:** Adoption of **Clean Architecture** to promote separation of concerns, enhancing the system's maintainability and scalability.
  - **Modeling Approach:** Utilization of the **C4 Model** to clearly define and communicate the interactions between the customer, gateway, and underlying services.
  - **Testing Support:** Incorporation of reflection in requests to simplify testing processes using tools like Postman and grpcurl.

## Decision

We have elected to proceed with the development of the **Link** domain as the foundational component of the ShortLink service. The key decisions made include:

1. **Language Choice:** Utilize **Go (Golang)** to leverage its performance and concurrency features.
2. **Architectural Style:** Implement **Clean Architecture** to ensure a well-organized and maintainable codebase.
3. **System Modeling:** Apply the **C4 Model** to outline and document system interactions comprehensively.
4. **Testing Facilitation:** Enable reflection in requests to streamline testing workflows for developers and users through tools such as Postman and grpcurl.

These decisions collectively aim to build a robust, efficient, and user-friendly service that meets both current and future requirements.

## Consequences

This decision marks the initiation of the ShortLink service, starting with the Link domain. We expect our 
choice of functionalities, Go as a programming language, the Clean Architecture, and the C4 model for outlining 
system interactions to result in an efficient and user-friendly service.

Supporting reflection in requests should simplify testing, but it does introduce a need for comprehensive documentation 
and usage examples, adding another ongoing commitment for our team.
