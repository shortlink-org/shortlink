# 2. C4 Model for Chat Service

Date: 2023-12-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Chat Service is a critical component of our system, providing real-time communication capabilities. 
As the complexity of the service grows, there is a need for a clear, comprehensive, and structured visualization of 
the system architecture. The C4 model is a framework for visualizing the architecture of software systems, 
and it can help us achieve this goal.

## Decision

We have decided to use the C4 model for visualizing the architecture of the Chat Service.
The C4 model will help us to visualize the static structures of the software system in terms of containers, 
components, and classes (or code). It will consist of a System Context diagram, a Container diagram, 
a Component diagram, and optionally, a Class diagram.

## Consequences


Implementing the C4 model will provide a clear and structured visualization of the Chat Service architecture. 
This will make it easier for both the current team and new members to understand the system architecture, 
which can lead to more efficient development and maintenance. However, maintaining the C4 diagrams will require additional 
effort and needs to be kept up to date as the system evolves.
