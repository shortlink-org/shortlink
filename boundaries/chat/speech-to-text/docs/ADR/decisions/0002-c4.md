## Level 2: Container Diagram

This diagram will show how the **speech-to-text** service (including whisper.cpp, Yandex Recognize, 
and Google's Speech-to-Text service) fits within the broader architecture of the Chat Service.

```plantuml
@startuml Container_Diagram
!includeurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Container.puml

Person(customer, "Customer", "Interacts with the Chat Service via Web/Mobile App.")

System_Boundary(chat_system, "Chat Service") {
    Container(chat_service, "Chat Service", "Handles messaging, voice messages, and other functionalities.")
    Container(speech_to_text_service, "Speech-to-Text Service", "Includes `whisper.cpp` for local processing and optional cloud-based processing.")
    ContainerDb(chat_db, "Chat Database", "Stores messages, user information, and voice-to-text data.")
    Container(media_storage, "Media Storage (MinIO)", "Stores audio files and other media.")
    Container(local_whisper, "Local whisper.cpp", "Local speech-to-text processing using whisper.cpp.")
}

System_Ext(yandex_service, "Yandex Recognize", "Optional cloud-based speech recognition service.")
System_Ext(google_service, "Google Speech-to-Text", "Optional cloud-based speech recognition service.")

Rel(customer, chat_service, "Uses")

## Level 3: Component Diagram

This diagram will focus on the internal structure of the Chat Service, particularly how it interacts with the **speech-to-text** components.

```plantuml
@startuml Component_Diagram
!includeurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Component.puml

Container_Ext(chat_service, "Chat Service")

Component(voice_message_component, "Voice Message Component", "Manages voice message functionalities, including recording, storage, and playback.")
Component(audio_conversion_component, "Audio Conversion Component", "Converts various audio formats to a standardized format (e.g., WAV 16bit) for speech-to-text processing.")
Component(speech_to_text_local, "Local Speech-to-Text", "Local speech-to-text processing using `whisper.cpp`.")
Component(speech_to_text_cloud, "Cloud Speech-to-Text", "Optional external speech-to-text services (Yandex, Google).")

System_Ext(whisper_cpp, "whisper.cpp", "Local speech-to-text processing.")
System_Ext(yandex_recognize, "Yandex Recognize", "External speech recognition service.")
System_Ext(google_speech_to_text, "Google Speech-to-Text", "External speech recognition service.")

Rel(voice_message_component, audio_conversion_component, "Sends audio for conversion")
Rel(voice_message_component, speech_to_text_local, "Uses for local voice-to-text conversion")
Rel(voice_message_component, speech_to_text_cloud, "Uses for optional cloud-based voice-to-text conversion")
Rel(speech_to_text_local, whisper_cpp, "Processes voice messages")
Rel(speech_to_text_cloud, yandex_recognize, "Integrates with for cloud-based processing", "Optional")
Rel(speech_to_text_cloud, google_speech_to_text, "Integrates with for cloud-based processing", "Optional")
Rel(chat_service, voice_message_component, "Uses")
