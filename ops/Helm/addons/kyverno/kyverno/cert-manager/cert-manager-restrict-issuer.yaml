      Certificates for trusted domains should always be steered to a controlled issuer to
      ensure the chain of trust is appropriate for that application. Users may otherwise be
      able to create their own issuers and sign certificates for other domains. This policy
      ensures that a certificate request for a specific domain uses a designated ClusterIssuer.
