For example, if the mask in the previous\n example is applied to a response message as follows:\n\n     f {\n       a : 22\n       b {\n         d : 1\n         x : 2\n       }\n       y : 13\n     }\n     z: 8\n\n The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z\n (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text\n output):\n\n\n     f {\n       a : 22\n       b {\n         d : 1\n       }\n     }\n\n A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a\n paths string.\n\n If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the\n operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields\n had been specified).\n\n Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the\n top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the\n field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST\n list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message\n in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,\n other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be\n clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In\n any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required\n behavior for APIs.\n\n # Field Masks in Update Operations\n\n A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the\n targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required\n to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask\n and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to\n describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all\n fields not covered by the mask.\n\n If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will\n be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that\n a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.\n\n If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an\n update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message\n in the target resource.\n\n For example, given the target message:\n\n     f {\n       b {\n         d: 1\n         x: 2\n       }\n       c: [1]\n     }\n\n And an update message:\n\n     f {\n       b {\n         d: 10\n       }\n       c: [2]\n     }\n\n then if the field mask is:\n\n  paths: [\"f.b\", \"f.c\"]\n\n then the result will be:\n\n     f {\n       b {\n         d: 10\n         x: 2\n       }\n       c: [1, 2]\n     }\n\n An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for\n repeated and message fields.\n\n In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must\n be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.\n Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default\n instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do\n not provide a mask as described below.\n\n If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to\n all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).\n Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that\n fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into\n the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted\n behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify\n a field mask, producing an error if not.\n\n As with get operations, the location of the resource which\n describes the updated values in the request message depends on the\n operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is\n required to be honored by the API.\n\n ## Considerations for HTTP REST\n\n The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must\n be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics\n (PUT must only be used for full updates).\n\n # JSON Encoding of Field Masks\n\n In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are\n separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted\n to/from lower-camel naming conventions.\n\n As an example, consider the following message declarations:\n\n     message Profile {\n       User user = 1;\n       Photo photo = 2;\n     }\n     message User {\n       string display_name = 1;\n       string address = 2;\n     }\n\n In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:\n\n     mask {\n       paths: \"user.display_name\"\n       paths: \"photo\"\n     }\n\n In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:\n\n     {\n       mask: \"user.displayName,photo\"\n     }\n\n # Field Masks and Oneof Fields\n\n Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the\n following message:\n\n     message SampleMessage {\n       oneof test_oneof {\n         string name = 4;\n         SubMessage sub_message = 9;\n       }\n     }\n\n The field mask can be:\n\n     mask {\n       paths: \"name\"\n     }\n\n Or:\n\n     mask {\n       paths: \"sub_message\"\n     }\n\n Note that oneof type names (\"test_oneof\" in this case) cannot be used in\n paths.\n\n ## Field Mask Verification\n\n The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the\n request should verify the included field paths, and return an\n `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.\n"},{"path":[4,0,1],"span":[241,8,17]},{"path":[4,0,2,0],"span":[243,2,28],"leadingComments":" The set of field mask paths.\n"},{"path":[4,0,2,0,4],"span":[243,2,10]},{"path":[4,0,2,0,5],"span":[243,11,17]},{"path":[4,0,2,0,1],"span":[243,18,23]},{"path":[4,0,2,0,3],"span":[243,26,27]}]},"syntax":"proto3","bufExtension":{"isImport":true,"isSyntaxUnspecified":false}},{"name":"domain/account/v1/account.proto","package":"domain.account.v1","dependency":["google/protobuf/field_mask.proto"],"enumType":[{"name":"Event","value":[{"name":"EVENT_UNSPECIFIED","number":0},{"name":"EVENT_ACCOUNT_NEW","number":1},{"name":"EVENT_ACCOUNT_DELETE","number":2}]}],"options":{"goPackage":"github.com/shortlink-org/shortlink/boundaries/billing/billing/internal/domain/account/v1"},"sourceCodeInfo":{"location":[{"span":[0,0,17,1]},{"path":[12],"span":[0,0,18]},{"path":[2],"span":[2,0,26]},{"path":[8],"span":[4,0,111]},{"path":[8,11],"span":[4,0,111]},{"path":[3,0],"span":[6,0,42]},{"path":[5,0],"span":[9,0,17,1],"leadingComments":" Event is a billing account event\n"},{"path":[5,0,1],"span":[9,5,10]},{"path":[5,0,2,0],"span":[11,2,24],"leadingComments":" event unspecified\n"},{"path":[5,0,2,0,1],"span":[11,2,19]},{"path":[5,0,2,0,2],"span":[11,22,23]},{"path":[5,0,2,1],"span":[14,2,24],"leadingComments":" account new\n"},{"path":[5,0,2,1,1],"span":[14,2,19]},{"path":[5,0,2,1,2],"span":[14,22,23]},{"path":[5,0,2,2],"span":[16,2,27],"leadingComments":" account delete\n"},{"path":[5,0,2,2,1],"span":[16,2,22]},{"path":[5,0,2,2,2],"span":[16,25,26]}]},"syntax":"proto3","bufExtension":{"isImport":false,"isSyntaxUnspecified":false,"unusedDependency":[0]}},{"name":"google/protobuf/timestamp.proto","package":"google.protobuf","messageType":[{"name":"Timestamp","field":[{"name":"seconds","number":1,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_INT64","jsonName":"seconds"},{"name":"nanos","number":2,"label":"LABEL_OPTIONAL","type":"TYPE_INT32","jsonName":"nanos"}]}],"options":{"javaPackage":"com.google.protobuf","javaOuterClassname":"TimestampProto","javaMultipleFiles":true,"goPackage":"google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/timestamppb","ccEnableArenas":true,"objcClassPrefix":"GPB","csharpNamespace":"Google.Protobuf.WellKnownTypes"},"sourceCodeInfo":{"location":[{"span":[30,0,143,1]},{"path":[12],"span":[30,0,18],"leadingDetachedComments":[" Protocol Buffers - Google's data interchange format\n Copyright 2008 Google Inc.

That is, the\n format is \"{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z\"\n where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day},\n {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional\n seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution),\n are optional. The \"Z\" suffix indicates the timezone (\"UTC\"); the timezone\n is required. A proto3 JSON serializer should always use UTC (as indicated by\n \"Z\") when printing the Timestamp type and a proto3 JSON parser should be\n able to accept both UTC and other timezones (as indicated by an offset).\n\n For example, \"2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z\" encodes 15.01 seconds past\n 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.\n\n In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the\n standard\n [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString)\n method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted\n to this format using\n [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with\n the time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use\n the Joda Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`](\n http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime()\n ) to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.\n\n"},{"path":[4,0,1],"span":[132,8,17]},{"path":[4,0,2,0],"span":[136,2,20],"leadingComments":" Represents seconds of UTC time since Unix epoch\n 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

It allows developers to build a single API service\n that supports both gRPC APIs and REST APIs. Many systems, including [Google\n APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis),\n [Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints), [gRPC\n Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway),\n and [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature\n and use it for large scale production services.\n\n `HttpRule` defines the schema of the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies\n how different portions of the gRPC request message are mapped to the URL\n path, URL query parameters, and HTTP request body. It also controls how the\n gRPC response message is mapped to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is\n typically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC method.\n\n Each mapping specifies a URL path template and an HTTP method. The path\n template may refer to one or more fields in the gRPC request message, as long\n as each field is a non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type.\n The path template controls how fields of the request message are mapped to\n the URL path.\n\n Example:\n\n     service Messaging {\n       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {\n         option (google.api.http) = {\n             get: \"/v1/{name=messages/*}\"\n         };\n       }\n     }\n     message GetMessageRequest {\n       string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path.\n     }\n     message Message {\n       string text = 1; // The resource content.\n     }\n\n This enables an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below:\n\n HTTP | gRPC\n -----|-----\n `GET /v1/messages/123456`  | `GetMessage(name: \"messages/123456\")`\n\n Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path template\n automatically become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body.\n For example:\n\n     service Messaging {\n       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {\n         option (google.api.http) = {\n             get:\"/v1/messages/{message_id}\"\n         };\n       }\n     }\n     message GetMessageRequest {\n       message SubMessage {\n         string subfield = 1;\n       }\n       string message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path.\n       int64 revision = 2;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `revision`.\n       SubMessage sub = 3;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `sub.subfield`.\n     }\n\n This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:\n\n HTTP | gRPC\n -----|-----\n `GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo` |\n `GetMessage(message_id: \"123456\" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield:\n \"foo\"))`\n\n Note that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a\n primitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type.\n In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL\n as `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the\n message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as\n `...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`.\n\n For HTTP methods that allow a request body, the `body` field\n specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the\n message resource collection:\n\n     service Messaging {\n       rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {\n         option (google.api.http) = {\n           patch: \"/v1/messages/{message_id}\"\n           body: \"message\"\n         };\n       }\n     }\n     message UpdateMessageRequest {\n       string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL\n       Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body\n     }\n\n The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the\n representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by\n protos JSON encoding:\n\n HTTP | gRPC\n -----|-----\n `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { \"text\": \"Hi!\" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:\n \"123456\" message { text: \"Hi!\" })`\n\n The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that\n every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the\n request body.  This enables the following alternative definition of\n the update method:\n\n     service Messaging {\n       rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {\n         option (google.api.http) = {\n           patch: \"/v1/messages/{message_id}\"\n           body: \"*\"\n         };\n       }\n     }\n     message Message {\n       string message_id = 1;\n       string text = 2;\n     }\n\n\n The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:\n\n HTTP | gRPC\n -----|-----\n `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { \"text\": \"Hi!\" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:\n \"123456\" text: \"Hi!\")`\n\n Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to\n have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in\n the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice when\n defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods\n which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.\n\n It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using\n the `additional_bindings` option. Example:\n\n     service Messaging {\n       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {\n         option (google.api.http) = {\n           get: \"/v1/messages/{message_id}\"\n           additional_bindings {\n             get: \"/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}\"\n           }\n         };\n       }\n     }\n     message GetMessageRequest {\n       string message_id = 1;\n       string user_id = 2;\n     }\n\n This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings:\n\n HTTP | gRPC\n -----|-----\n `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: \"123456\")`\n `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: \"me\" message_id:\n \"123456\")`\n\n ## Rules for HTTP mapping\n\n 1. Leaf request fields (recursive expansion nested messages in the request\n    message) are classified into three categories:\n    - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the URL path.\n    - Fields referred by the [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body]. They\n    are passed via the HTTP\n      request body.\n    - All other fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the\n      parameter name is the field path in the request message. A repeated\n      field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the same\n      name.\n  2. If [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body] is \"*\", there is no URL\n  query parameter, all fields\n     are passed via URL path and HTTP request body.\n  3. If [HttpRule.body][google.api.HttpRule.body] is omitted, there is no HTTP\n  request body, all\n     fields are passed via URL path and URL query parameters.\n\n ### Path template syntax\n\n     Template = \"/\" Segments [ Verb ] ;\n     Segments = Segment { \"/\" Segment } ;\n     Segment  = \"*\" | \"**\" | LITERAL | Variable ;\n     Variable = \"{\" FieldPath [ \"=\" Segments ] \"}\" ;\n     FieldPath = IDENT { \".\" IDENT } ;\n     Verb     = \":\" LITERAL ;\n\n The syntax `*` matches a single URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches\n zero or more URL path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path\n except the `Verb`.\n\n The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its\n template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable\n matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`\n is equivalent to `{var=*}`.\n\n The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If the `LITERAL`\n contains any reserved character, such characters should be percent-encoded\n before the matching.\n\n If a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `\"{var}\"` or\n `\"{var=*}\"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client\n side, all characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The\n server side does the reverse decoding. Such variables show up in the\n [Discovery\n Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as\n `{var}`.\n\n If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as `\"{var=foo/*}\"`\n or `\"{var=**}\"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the\n client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded.\n The server side does the reverse decoding, except \"%2F\" and \"%2f\" are left\n unchanged. Such variables show up in the\n [Discovery\n Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as\n `{+var}`.\n\n ## Using gRPC API Service Configuration\n\n gRPC API Service Configuration (service config) is a configuration language\n for configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The\n service config is simply the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service`\n proto message.\n\n As an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC\n transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a\n `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same\n effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you\n have a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding\n specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding\n configuration in the proto.\n\n Example:\n\n     http:\n       rules:\n         # Selects a gRPC method and applies HttpRule to it.\n         - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage\n           get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}\n\n ## Special notes\n\n When gRPC Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the\n proto to JSON conversion must follow the [proto3\n specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).\n\n While the single segment variable follows the semantics of\n [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String\n Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section\n 3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion\n does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead\n to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding\n for multi segment variables.\n\n The path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or mapped field,\n because client libraries are not capable of handling such variable expansion.\n\n The path variables **must not** capture the leading \"/\" character. The reason\n is that the most common use case \"{var}\" does not capture the leading \"/\"\n character. For consistency, all path variables must share the same behavior.\n\n Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL query parameters, because\n no client library can support such complicated mapping.\n\n If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body, it can map\n the request or response body to a repeated field. However, some gRPC\n Transcoding implementations may not support this feature.\n"},{"path":[4,1,1],"span":[315,8,16]},{"path":[4,1,2,0],"span":[320,2,22],"leadingComments":" Selects a method to which this rule applies.\n\n Refer to [selector][google.api.DocumentationRule.selector] for syntax\n details.\n"},{"path":[4,1,2,0,5],"span":[320,2,8]},{"path":[4,1,2,0,1],"span":[320,9,17]},{"path":[4,1,2,0,3],"span":[320,20,21]},{"path":[4,1,8,0],"span":[325,2,347,3],"leadingComments":" Determines the URL pattern is matched by this rules.

This is used whenever a set of elements are\n   logically enclosed in a single code segment.  For example, an entire\n   extend block (possibly containing multiple extension definitions) will\n   have an outer location whose path refers to the \"extensions\" repeated\n   field without an index.\n - Multiple locations may have the same path.  This happens when a single\n   logical declaration is spread out across multiple places.  The most\n   obvious example is the \"extend\" block again -- there may be multiple\n   extend blocks in the same scope, each of which will have the same path.\n - A location's span is not always a subset of its parent's span.  For\n   example, the \"extendee\" of an extension declaration appears at the\n   beginning of the \"extend\" block and is shared by all extensions within\n   the block.\n - Just because a location's span is a subset of some other location's span\n   does not mean that it is a descendant.  For example, a \"group\" defines\n   both a type and a field in a single declaration.  Thus, the locations\n   corresponding to the type and field and their components will overlap.\n - Code which tries to interpret locations should probably be designed to\n   ignore those that it doesn't understand, as more types of locations could\n   be recorded in the future.\n"},{"path":[4,21,2,0,4],"span":[1094,2,10]},{"path":[4,21,2,0,6],"span":[1094,11,19]},{"path":[4,21,2,0,1],"span":[1094,20,28]},{"path":[4,21,2,0,3],"span":[1094,31,32]},{"path":[4,21,3,0],"span":[1095,2,1178,3]},{"path":[4,21,3,0,1],"span":[1095,10,18]},{"path":[4,21,3,0,2,0],"span":[1119,4,44],"leadingComments":" Identifies which part of the FileDescriptorProto was defined at this\n location.\n\n Each element is a field number or an index.
