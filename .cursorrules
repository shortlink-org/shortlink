# Cursor AI Rules for Shortlink Project

## Git Operations

**CRITICAL: Git Push Policy**

- NEVER execute `git push` automatically without explicit user permission
- ALWAYS ask the user before pushing changes to remote repository
- When user says "commit and push" or similar, ask for confirmation before pushing
- Only push when user explicitly confirms with "yes", "push", or similar affirmative response
- If user says "commit" without mentioning push, only commit, do NOT push
- If user says "сам не пуш" or "don't push", NEVER push, only commit

## General Guidelines

- Always check git status before making changes
- Show diff before committing
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages in **English language only**
- All commit messages must be written in English
- Prefer pnpm for Node.js projects (project uses pnpm v10)
